# 🚀 My Kubernetes Journey
Hands-on Kubernetes learning journey with concepts, YAML manifests, practical projects, and detailed notes — documenting my path to becoming a DevOps Engineer.

**📌 What’s Inside**

-  Concepts & Notes → Easy-to-understand explanations of Kubernetes fundamentals.
-  YAML Manifests → Real-world examples with comments for quick learning.
-  Mini Projects → End-to-end setups (Nginx, MySQL, WordPress, Monitoring, etc.).
-  heat Sheets → Handy kubectl commands, API versions, and interview prep.
-  EKS (AWS) → Notes & configs for running Kubernetes on AWS.

**🎯 Learning Roadmap**

1. Kubernetes Basics → Pods, Deployments, Services, Namespaces  
2. Configuration → ConfigMaps, Secrets, Volumes  
3. Workload Types → StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs  
4. Networking → Ingress, LoadBalancer, Network Policies  
5. Storage → Persistent Volumes, Storage Classes, PVCs  
6. Security → RBAC, Service Accounts, Admission Controllers  
7. Monitoring → Prometheus, Grafana, Metrics Server  
8. Cloud → Deploying to AWS EKS  


**🛠️ Tech Stack**

- Kubernetes (k8s)  
- Docker  
- AWS EKS  
- Helm (later stage)  
- GitHub Actions / Jenkins for CI/CD
